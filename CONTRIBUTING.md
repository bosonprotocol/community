# Contributing

This is an organization-wide Contributing.md, which lists the default expectations and norms for contributing to any repository in @bosonprotocol. Any local Contributing.md can override this, but this is meant to be a source of truth for how to work together effectively.

## Tests

All commits in a pull request should pass tests before being submitted.

## Branch naming schemas

Please keep branch names to `a-zA-Z0-9-` (alphanumeric characters, and `-`).

## Attribution

When possible, we use [`git authors`](https://github.com/tj/git-extras/blob/master/Commands.md#git-authors) to automatically source contributors for both `package.json` files and for a `CONTRIBUTORS.md` doc in repositories. However, this only counts _code contributions_ from developers, which is not the only type of contribution; there are many other types, like offering design or advice.

In these cases, names may be added to the Contributors list if someone suggests that name.

## Something missing?

If there's a norm or a rule missing, please add it in a Pull Request, or open an issue.
