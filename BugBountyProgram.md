# Boson Protocol Bug Bounty

Boson Protocol is the decentralized network on which future commerce will run. And it starts with metaverse commerce. Boson Protocol enables anyone to sell physical products in the metaverse as NFTs, and we demonstrate the Protocol’s capabilities within our Decentraland space – Boson Portal.

With Boson Protocol you can build commerce applications that anyone can trust and everyone can use.

At Boson, we take security seriously. We are calling out to all security researchers worldwide to help us identify and fix weaknesses in our solution. 

We are reshaping commerce for the new Web3 era and we need your help to succeed! If you have discovered a bug, please contact us and join the Boson Protocol Bug Bounty as soon as possible and we will make sure that you get your reward!

## The Bounty

## Boson Protocol Contracts

| Low  | Medium | High    | Critical      |
| ---- | ------ | ------- | ------------- |
| $100 | $500   | $10,000 | Up to $50,000 |

## Boson Portal

| Low  | Medium | High   | Critical      |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | ------------- |
| $100 | $500   | $2,000 | Up to $10,000 |

Your report will be assessed by the Boson Protocol team and scored using the Common Vulnerability Scoring Scheme (CVSS).

The critical asset bounty will only be awarded where there is a serious and potentially permanent impact to a user's funds, or to the core protocol itself.

The bug bounty program considers a number of variables in determining rewards. Determinations of eligibility, score and all terms related to an award are at the sole and final discretion of Boson Protocol. We will not be awarding significant bounties for low severity bugs. Rewards will be paid in USDC

Issues that have already been submitted by another user or are already known to Boson Protocol are not eligible for bounty rewards.

## SLA

Boson Protocol will make a best effort to meet the following SLAs for security researchers participating in our program:

- Time to first response (from report submission) - 3 business days
- Time to triage (from report submission) - 5 business days
- Time to bounty (from triage) - 30 business days

We’ll try to keep you informed about our progress throughout the process.

##What we are interested in

The most important class of bugs we’re looking for are ones that would cause our users to lose access to their funds. Whether this be through gaining admin privileges on the protocol or through a mechanism that renders funds frozen and unusable within the escrow system. These along with any vulnerabilities that could be used to to defraud potential buyers and sellers are deemed the most important class of exploits- for example, vulnerabilities within the NFT Voucher that is used to commit to a sale or purchase.

Of lesser importance but still of interest are any vulnerabilities in the Portal interface that may allow users to gain unauthorized advantage in any of the Quests or to obtain private information about other users or Boson Protocol’s partners.

## Scope

We are primarily inviting vulnerability reports relating to the Boson Protocol Contracts repo and to the Boson Portal user interface.

(This document)[https://github.com/bosonprotocol/contracts/blob/main/docs/contracts/deployment.md] contains the most up to date contract addresses on the Ethereum main net and on Ethereum’s Ropsten test net.

Note that we are only interested in bugs on the release tagged “Latest” in (this document)[https://github.com/bosonprotocol/contracts/releases], not in pre-releases or any other branches.
