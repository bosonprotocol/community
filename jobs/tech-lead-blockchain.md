We are looking for a Technical Lead that can comfortably navigate the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem and technologies. You will take initiative in designing and building at the bleeding edge of technology with immediate application in real life. The ideal candidate will have prior experience in a technical leadership position supporting and mentoring a diverse team of engineers, as well as experience building and shipping enterprise and consumer facing products. We don't need you to have an engineering or equivalent degree, though it is desirable. Our main focus is on your past experience and how you delivered results.

This role is for a long-term relationship, working predominantly remotely, becoming an integral part of an international team. Technical Leads will report directly to the CTO and as the organisation grows, to other senior technical leaders.

- Keep up to date with the latest developments in blockchain technology and grow our internal capability.
- Closely collaborate with internal and external experts within various technical domains.
- Help the team champion software quality while being pragmatic.

- Leading and facilitating workshops with both business and technical teams to foster alignment.
- Cryptography and using zero knowledge proofs as a privacy-preserving and scalable technology.
- Ethereum and operating a blockchain product, familiarity with other blockchain networks is a plus.
- Different scalability approaches, such as rollups and sidechains, knowledge of zk rollups is a big plus.
