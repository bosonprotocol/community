_Copied verbatim from [here](https://boards.greenhouse.io/bosonprotocol/jobs/4329321003)_.

## Role Summary

We are looking for an experienced User Experience designer who knows first hand the limitations of being a pioneer within the Web3 and DeFi space. We see a future of dCommerce where people can exchange value safely, fairly and there is a bridge between the metaverse and the universe. In order to achieve this, we realise we need to serve our users and partners in a way that is ever better than the status quo.

Cryptocurrency and DeFi is still in its infancy, while ecommerce has been around for decades, so there is some catching up to do. If we are to build a new way of doing commerce, we need our users to realise the wider benefits of this but also to have a seamless experience that is both intuitive and pleasant for all parties.

Simply applying Web2 principles to DeFi isnâ€™t good enough, there are too many nuances for it to be that easy. You could argue that many eCommerce and traditional finance organisations are yet to grasp this properly, and we need to be a step ahead of them. This is where you come in.

Working across multiple work streams and projects you will be guiding and user first mindset on our product suite, from an end user perspective but also in terms of retailer and developer experience.

- Grow and foster a Web3 UX mindset within the product and engineering teams
- Finding viable workarounds to overcome the limitations of Web3 usability
- Work with partners and portfolio businesses to guide their user experience processes

- Experience in UX design within Web3 / Crypto
- Hands on experience with using various UX and design tools
- Building storyboards 
- Mapping user journeys 
- Startup experience
- Be able to work in a remote, distributed team
